				<p>
				1.  The recipe should be simple, easy to read, and interesting to the reader.<br>
				2. The ingredients should be listed in the order they are to be used.<br>
				3. Exact measurements should be indicated; if possible abbreviation should be avoided.<br>
				         Example: ½ cup chopped tomatoes not ½ cup chopped tomatoes<br>
				4. Descriptive terms should be placed before the ingredients if the process is to be carried out before measurement.<br>
				         Example: 2 cups sifted flour<br>
				If the process is carried out after measurements, the terms are placed under the ingredients.<br>
				        Example: 2 cups flour, sifted<br>
				5. Whenever possible, it is desirable to use simple measurements.<br>
				•	 Fractional measurements in a cup ( ½, ¼,1/3 cups)<br>
				•	   Weight of uncooked meat, poultry, fish (1/2 kilo, 4 lbs. etc.)<br>
				•	    Measure and weight of canned packaged products ( 5 oz. can tomato sauce, 1lb. cheese)<br> 
				 
				6. Specify the particular type of ingredients to be used. If cake flour is the preferred ingredient, specify as 2 cups cake flour instead of 2 cups flour.<br>
				7. Use the generic names of the ingredients rather than brand names.<br>
				Example: flour – generic name<br>
				                 Victoria Mills – brand name<br>
				8.Short and clear sentences that give the necessary information help to make directions understandable.<br>
				9. Use the precise term to describe a cooking process or a preparation method. Do not say mix when you mean fold or beat.<br>
				10. Specify the size of the baking pan or utensils needed. State clearly how preparation should be made.<br>
				         Example: oiling, greasing,  Lining with wax paper<br>
				11. State information regarding the temperature and cooking time to ensure successful results. A statement to describe the stage is most helpful.<br>
				        Example: Bake for 25 minutes at 350°F until it is golden brown<br>
				12. Every recipe should indicate its yield in terms or average servings.<br>
				       Example: Makes 4 servings.
